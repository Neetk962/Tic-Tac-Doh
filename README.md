# Description
Our final group project we created from scratch this Tic-Tac-Toe game themed with 'The Simpsons'. Using MERN-stack single-page application, MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT. This Multi-Player Tic-Tac-Toe game allows you to create a user ID, update passwords, delete your account and play our live Tic-Tac-DOH! game.
