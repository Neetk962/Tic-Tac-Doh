## Description

### Overview

Our final group project we created from scratch this Tic-Tac-Toe game themed with 'The Simpsons'. Using MERN-stack single-page application, MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT. This Multi-Player Tic-Tac-Toe game allows you to create a user ID, update passwords, delete your account and play our live Tic-Tac-DOH! game.

### Motivation

We created this project to play Tic-Tac-Toe with friends on a Simpsons themed page! As a group we went into the start of creating the project wanting to start and comple a robust app as well.

### What We Learned

As a group we learned more about integrating login technologies, creating responsive user interface, managing game logic, and a marco view of web development in general!
